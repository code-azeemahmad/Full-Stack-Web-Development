1.  Postman is more powerful than browser testing
    because it lets you simulate real API clients.
2.  In DevTools Network tab, you can only inspect
    what the browser sends, but with Postman you can
    send anything you want.
3.  A browser can only send GET requests (and sometimes POST via forms).
4.  But with Postman, you can test any HTTP method
    (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) with custom headers and body data.

5.  It also shows you the status code, headers, and response body very clearly.
