1. Why should we use express?
2. Why Nodemon?
3. Installing Express@4
4. Request parameters and queries
5. Static Files

Express Js, with the help of Node js, is a framework for web development
to make production level web applications.

6. Need of Express js:
   --> Capabilities of HTTP package is limited.
   --> can't serve static files
   --> security should be implemented from the first
   --> how will you manage things after making server.
   --> to not write custom code for get/ post request

7. while learning any framework like express js, we should go to
   its documentation. We don't cram code. Someone is teaching you
   how to code without seeing its documentation, that's not good.
   Everything comes from a source or has a source.
