Jordan Walke - Meta Engineer, the creator of React

# Why use React?
- We can use states which means that once we update the variable, 
  it changes the across the page
- React demands to make variables that update the inner html or dom 
  by updating those variables
- You don't have to write dom 
- With react, code can be broken down into reusable modular components
- Concept of props
