Jordan Walke - Meta Engineer, the creator of React

# Why use React?
- We can use states which means that once we update the variable, 
  it changes the across the page
- React demands to make variables that update the inner html or dom 
  by updating those variables
- You don't have to write dom 
- With react, code can be broken down into reusable modular components
- Concept of props

# Key Points
- All the code is present in src
- node_modules, its an npm project
- public contains directly acccessible things(all static files)
- div id="root" in /public/index.html contains all the react app that was written in /src/index.js
- Focus on App.js, App.css
- JSX looks like html but converted into js
