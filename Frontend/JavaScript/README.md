Javascript is intended to introduce interactivity into a Website.

JavaScript can be used both on the frontend and the backend, but in different ways. Here's a clear breakdown:
___________________________________________________________________________

✅ Frontend (Client-Side) JavaScript
    ~~> Used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. Runs in the browser.

Common Uses:
--> DOM manipulation (change HTML elements, CSS, etc.)
--> Handling user events (clicks, form inputs)
--> Form validation before submitting to server
--> Making API calls using fetch or XMLHttpRequest
--> Animations and visual effects
--> Client-side routing (in frameworks like React)
___________________________________________________________________________

✅ Backend (Server-Side) JavaScript
    ~~> Runs on the server using Node.js (a JavaScript runtime environment).

Common Uses:
--> Handle HTTP requests/responses
--> Connect to databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL)
--> Perform server-side logic and authentication
--> Serve HTML/CSS/JS files
--> Create REST APIs

browser specific like alert
