    <h1>CSS Specificity and Cascade</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules
        appear
      </li>
      <li>
        Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the
        strongest match
        <p style="color: blue">
          Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element
          Selector > Universal Selector
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether
        that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored
        CSS
      </li>
      <li>
        Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others,
        especially with the !important rule type
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
      <h2>Specificity Calculation</h2>
      <pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
            Universal Selector: 0
            Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
            Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
            ID selectors: 100
            Inline styles: 1000
            Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector.
        </pre
      >
    </div>
  </body>
