    <h1>CSS Specificity and Cascade</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules
        appear
      </li>
      <li>
        Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the
        strongest match
        <p style="color: blue">
          Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element
          Selector > Universal Selector
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether
        that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored
        CSS
      </li>
      <li>
        Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others,
        especially with the !important rule type
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
      <h2>Specificity Calculation</h2>
      <pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
            Universal Selector: 0
            Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
            Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
            ID selectors: 100
            Inline styles: 1000
            Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector.
        </pre
      >
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>ðŸ”¹ 3. Origin</h2>
        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            â†’ Where the CSS rule comes from. Some sources are weaker or stronger by default.
            
            There are 3 types of origins:

                       CSS Type	                             Strength Order (Weak â†’ Strong)
            User agent styles (browser default)	                       Weakest
            User styles (user-defined)	                               Medium
            Author styles (your CSS)	                               Strong

        Your author styles override the browser default styles â€” even if specificity is the same.
