                                CLASS 
The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements.
That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not
unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying
the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.

                                  ID 
An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one
HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling
and JavaScript manipulations

Both are attributes of an element and are called css selectors

One Id to one element
Multiple elements in one class and multiple classes in one element by placing space


Id are alse used to generate links from a website like wikipedia and
when you place link using hashtag in the search bar, it will navigate
you to the targeted place or paragraph
