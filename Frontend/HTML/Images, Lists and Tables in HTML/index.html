<!-- Place the image in the same folder which contains the html file.
     It means both html file and image has same pathway -->
<!-- write img to the src attribute of the img tag. -->
<!-- alt="" shows the text that will be displayed if the image is not loaded. 
     It simply means name of image or description when there is error in uploading image in html file-->
<!-- There are two important inline css attributes in the img tag that are width and height
Just write numbers in double quotes, no need to write px as in external css.
write only one attribute as the other attribute sets automatically -->
