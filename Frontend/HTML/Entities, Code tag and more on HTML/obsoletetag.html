Obsolete HTML Tags
As HTML has evolved, some tags have been deprecated or become obsolete.
While modern browsers might still support them, their use is discouraged
in favor of CSS or more semantic HTML5 elements. In this blog, we'll
explore some of these obsolete tags and their modern alternatives.

What Are Obsolete Tags?
Obsolete tags are HTML elements that are no longer recommended for use.
They may lack support in modern browsers and are likely to be phased out
entirely in future versions of HTML.

Why Avoid Obsolete Tags?
Compatibility Issues: Not supported by all modern browsers.
Accessibility: This may not meet current web accessibility standards.
Maintenance: Makes future updates difficult.
