What Are HTML Entities?
HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format
that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&)
and end with a semicolon (;).

Why Use HTML Entities?
Here are some reasons:

Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line.

Common HTML Entities
&lt;  for <
&gt;  for >
&amp; for &
&nbsp; for a non-breaking space
&copy; for ©
