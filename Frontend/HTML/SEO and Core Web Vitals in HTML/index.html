    <ul>
        <li>LCP ( Largest Contentful Paint ) for Loading</li>
        <li>FID ( First Input Delay ) for Interactivity</li>
        <li>CLS ( Cumulative Layout Shift ) for Visual Stability</li>
    </ul>

        <dt>SEO</dt>
        <dd>Browser will Prefer or set that website to high priority
            which loads fast and loads things in a good manner</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>So that their products can come in search Google is a search engine Google's responsibility is to show the best pages to the users So Google will only want to show those pages that will be fast Present very good information, and have good user experience. For example, let's say there are two pages, one page has told about dog food, the other page has also told about dog food. But the page 2 of these two is loaded very fast, so Google will give it more preference. </p>
        <h1>CORE WEB VITALS</h1>
        <p>Along with that, there are core web vitals, which google considers to rank two pages first of all content is important if your content is good then maybe your website can rank without core web vitals but if you are competing with a page which has similar quality content then your core web vitals will be seen and if your core web vitals are good then you will be given preference so in core web vitals.</p>
        <h2>CLS</h2>
        <p>First comes your cls you see this video here which I have run from web.dev website you will see that someone comes to your website and he is trying to cancel the order here and by mistake the time he canceled this thing above became visible and he shifted the layout and the order was completed but the user wanted the order to be completed and he wanted to click on no in this case the user experience is very bad and as you have seen in this video, it should not be like this that's why our CLS should be minimum now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative Layout Shift means how much is shifting while the page is loading suppose you have loaded the page and first of all you get to see this it was above and after that when this key term part was loaded, then everything was shifted down the layout should not be shifted if you put width and height in images then the layout will not be shifted</p>
        <h2>LCP</h2>
        <p>the next metric we are going to talk about is LCP and LCP stands for Largest Contentful Paint this means that if the user is viewing a page then the biggest element on it for example, the biggest part in this is this image how long is it loading means the whole page will be loaded but the biggest element is loaded in how much time. The whole page will be loaded but the biggest element
            
            which is the most important is loaded in how much time. According to web.dev and google, a good LCP score should be 2.5 seconds. That is, the biggest element of the page should be loaded in 2.5 seconds. After this comes the third metric which is FID which stands for first input delay. First input delay means that if any user clicks on any input element Like a button or any type of input on a page So how long does that input process For example, if you click on a button, how long does that button click browser process
            And according to google and web.dev, your input should start processing in less than 100 milliseconds So these were the three core web vitals which are very important </p>
